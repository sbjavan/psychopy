This directory contains all the source files for the stroop test.
The "stroopex.py" file contains the main source code, while the "stroopex_lastrun" stores a copy of the latest run settings.

STEPS TO RUN THE TEST:
  1) Install all the dependencies from the "dependencies.txt" file.
  2) Open the "stroopex.py" using the PsychoPy GUI and tune the experiment as required.
  3) To run it you could use GUI or simple execute the source file on your terminal.
  
NOTE: You might come accross a lot of errors during setting up PsychoPy. Also, you might want to avoid pip as it doesn't install the GUI which makes life way easier.
